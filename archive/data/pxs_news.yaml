    <p>

    </p><p>A brand new webcomic, to be exact. One that has launched on the 5th anniversary
    of Homestuck''s first page. If the thirteenth of April holds a magical place in
    your heart, then chances are, you are on pins and needles waiting for me to post
    the end of the story. It will still be quite some time before that happens. I''ve
    had too much else going on to be able to attack the remaining content with the
    ferocity that has been characteristic of my update schedule over the years. It
    is nothing short of The Greatest Tragedy that a beloved story is held hostage
    to the ability of a single artist to continue creating it. Which brings us to
    the website called Paradox Space, and the chapter it will represent in Homestuck''s
    extended life cycle.</p>

    <p>As I work on finishing the story, I tend to think a lot about where Homestuck
    as a creative property goes from here. It''s hard to ignore the fact that it has
    turned into something much bigger than just a long, crazy story on the internet.
    It has a lot of fans, and there''s a whole culture surrounding it. Friendships
    have been made, lives have been changed, or so people tell me. Those who like
    HS are extremely fond of the characters, yet those characters are trapped - "stuck"
    if you will - inside a very particular narrative, which itself has been at the
    mercy of my ability to produce it. So when I think about the future of Homestuck,
    I envision projects which liberate the things people love about it from the story
    itself, and most importantly, from my intensive personal effort.</p>

    <p>So this website is the first major step in that direction. Here is the idea:</p>

    <p>Paradox Space will feature many short comic stories involving literally any
    characters and settings from Homestuck. Any point in canon could be visited and
    elaborated on, whether it''s backstory, some scenes that were skipped over or
    alluded to, funny hypothetical scenarios which have nothing to do with canon events,
    or exploring things that could have happened in canon through the "doomed timeline"
    mechanic that is a defining trait of Homestuck''s multiverse-continuum known as
    "paradox space". There is a WHOLE LOT of fun stuff we can do here; and we will!</p>

    <p>The idea is also to get a lot of different artists and writers involved. It''s
    going to be a major team effort. Occasionally I will write some comic scripts,
    particularly at the onset to help get this off the ground. But I''d like that
    to be the exception rather than the rule. I think it will be exciting to see how
    a talented pool of creators can work within the HS universe, and what they will
    bring to these characters. Scroll down to the bottom of the page to see who''s
    contributing so far. I guarantee that list of names will expand considerably in
    the months ahead.</p>

    <p>And a quick shout-out to those I regard as the core contributors of Paradox
    Space. Rachel and Kory, who are the managing editors of the content. Tauhid, who
    designed this sick website. And Matt, who coded this sick website. These people
    worked very hard to get this site up and running. They did a great job.</p>

    <p>Paradox Space updates with a new page every weekday, starting this week. Next
    update is Tuesday, with the first page of another short story. What''s it gonna
    be?? Believe me when I say these arcs can involve anything and anyone.</p>

    <p>The first story was drawn by Zack Morrison, who is a super solid comic maker.
    You should take a look at <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140413205013/http://www.paranatural.net/"
    target="_blank">his webcomic</a> when you get the chance. It''s really good! I''m
    not even "just sayin" that either. Why do ya think we asked him to make the first
    comic?? Dude''s great. ;-]</p>

    <p>

    </p><p>And... yep. Went STRAIGHT to the well of juggalo humor, right off the bat.
    Were you honestly expecting anything else? Frankly, shame on you if you were.</p>

    <p>"Headed for Stardom" is by Jonathan Griffiths. Observe more of his fine work
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423230534/http://www.beyondthecanopy.com/"
    target="_blank">over here</a>!</p>

    <p>Soon I will take a step back from this news section and let other voices emerge.
    I''m the stern guardian figure pushing several frightened children on a rickety
    little bike, and they''re all nervous as hell. But I''m not. I''m smiling and
    beaming with pride as I let go of the bike at the top of a steep hill, which has
    a ramp at the bottom that launches over Sadcorpse Canyon. They''re not sure if
    they can make it. But I know they can. I know they can. (Also, they''re chained
    to the bike.)</p>

    <p>Now for a few "frequently asked questions", or as I like to call them, FREQAQUES.</p>

    <p><u>Do you have an RSS feed?</u></p>

    <p>Yes, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423230534/http://www.paradoxspace.com/rss.atom"
    target="_blank">here it is</a>. </p>

    <p><u>Are these comics canon?</u></p>

    <p>I think you will have to use your own judgment on that. Sometimes there''s
    going to be some truly ridiculous nonsense that could not have possibly happened
    in canon. Other times, the events portrayed will at least be plausible, and will
    present no contradiction. Does that then mean those events are canon? Hard to
    say. A formal ruling here does not seem appropriate. </p>

    <p>If you want me to give you some guidelines that are AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE, here
    you go. For any given story, it is either "Definitely Not Canon" or "Possibly
    Canon". But no story should ever be regarded as "Definitely Canon", unless Homestuck
    itself confirms those events retroactively in some manner. Does that make sense??</p>

    <p><u>I really want to know about X, but Paradox Space keeps running a lot of
    silly shit that isn''t answering my questions about Homestuck.</u></p>

    <p>This isn''t frequently asked yet (also, it isn''t a question), but I''m anticipating
    the sentiment. Primarily, PS content will involve a lot of silly, funny stories
    that feature fun characters saying stupid things to each other and doing funny,
    silly things together. Much like Homestuck itself! SOMETIMES, these stories may
    brush with topics or events that weren''t fully elaborated on in Homestuck, and
    may offer some intriguing insight into what might have happened during certain
    unembellished portions of canon. But such stories are not guaranteed to be the
    site''s principle offering. Viewing it as an effort to pad out HS by filling all
    the holes and answering all the mysteries is not the right way to look at it.
    The right way to look at it is to see PS as a funny source of entertainment, where
    funny and entertaining comics are posted every weekday. And sometimes, those comics
    will be "interesting" as well.</p>

    <p>We round out our first week of Paradox Space with a comic by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423230534/http://www.gunshowcomic.com/">KC
    Green</a>! You may remember this Zoo from KC''s comic <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423230534/http://gunshowcomic.com/250">Gunshow</a>,
    or maybe <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423230534/http://horribleville.com/d/20060312.html">another

    404 images, which you can find by breaking the site (note: Matt has told me not
    to ask you to break the site on purpose I am sorry).</p>

    <p>Some people have expressed their disappointment that the first week of Paradox
    Space did not include their favorite characters, but remember, this was just the
    first week! We have loads of plans to feature all your favorite characters. Yes
    even that one. Probably. Most likely.</p>

    <p>

    </p><p>Well hello. It is me, Rachel, your new owl friend. Very nice to meet you.</p>

    <p>This week we will be enjoying <a href="/pxs/prototyped/1">"Prototyped,"</a>
    from the illustrious Zack Morrison, who--again--creates the fantastic comic <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423230534/http://paranatural.net/">Paranatural</a>.
    When I say we will be enjoying it, I mean we <em>will</em> be enjoying it. If
    you do not experience enjoyment please report to your local Paradox Space Re-Education
    Center, because there has been a malfunction. </p>

    <p>I guess now it is incumbent upon me to answer some questions also! </p>

    <p><strong>I have a great idea and/or script and/or drawing! Can I submit it?</strong></p>

    <p>I''m sorry, but at present we are not open to submissions, and we have no current
    plans to open submissions. You can check out our <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140423230534/http://paradoxspace.com/contact_us">contact</a>
    page if you are ever curious if we are opening submissions.</p>

    <p><strong>Who is drawing the current comic?</strong></p>

    <p>You can find this information in several places--on the title page or panel
    of the story, on our <a href="/pxs/">stories
    page</a>, or on the footer of any image in the story (a recommendation from a
    reader!). If you''re going to repost any image from Paradox Space, <strong>please
    keep the footer intact.</strong> It''s respectful to the artists and allows people
    who see the image but may not be familiar with PXS to find us! </p>

    <p><strong>Why is this more John bullshit? John is personally victimizing me.</strong></p>

    <p>Oddly, John is an important character in the comic. We, as much as you, relish
    the chance that Paradox Space gives us to tell stories from characters who don''t
    get as much screen time. Have patience!</p>

    <p>Anyway, you are required to enjoy this comic, as it is great. Paranatural is
    a comic you should definitely read between Paradox Space updates (we have helpfully
    allowed you to keep your weekends free for this activity). Relatedly, "Attack
    the Block" is a good movie. </p>

  title: My name isn't really that cool
- author: Rachel
  body: '<div class="media-body">

    <p>

    </p><p>Hello again my friends. Welcome to the weekend! Have you caught up on <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428200852/http://paranatural.net/">Paranatural</a>
    yet? </p>

    <p>It seems I have a few small issues to address! It is raining here and therefore
    the title to this post is appropriate and funny (you are not required to laugh).
    </p>

    <p>Some people have expressed severe negative reactions to Karkat''s having a
    pink tongue in this comic. For reference, I''ve come up with a series of exploratory
    questions one can ask oneself to figure out whether an issue in a comic is one
    that''s worth fretting over.</p>

    <p><strong>Is this something that is important to canon?</strong></p>

    <p>Karkat''s blood color would be an important thing, and would be a big mistake
    if we got it wrong! Karkat''s tongue color, on the other hand, has not been mentioned
    in canon. We can assume that unless tongue color turns out to be an extremely
    important part of beating Lord English, it is probably not important at all. </p>

    <p><strong>Is this important to the story being told?</strong></p>

    <p>Sometimes things that aren''t important to canon can be important to the small
    stories that we tell. But since Karkat''s tongue hasn''t been important (yet?!)
    in this story, it''s probably not important at all.</p>

    <p>I don''t want to make light of small quibbles! (Okay, I do, but not too much.)
    I understand that canon adherence is really important to some people. But that''s
    not what we''re really about here. If you''re looking for information, the <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428200852/http://mspaintadventures.wikia.com/wiki/Homestuck">Homestuck
    wiki</a> is remarkably well-kept by its very dedicated caretakers. (In fact, so
    well-kept that we often use it to check our stories and refresh our memories.)
    But Paradox Space is going to generally be much more about telling stories than
    it is about canonicity. </p>

    <p>I''m also aware that there''s been some dismay that no stories yet have reached
    the full depth of emotion that Homestuck itself has. To this I''m sort of forced
    to say, Well, duh. So far we''ve been telling short, lighthearted stories. Homestuck
    has literally thousands of pages to move smoothly (or sometimes not that smoothly)
    between emotional gears; our longest story so far is this seven-page one that''s
    running! We do have some more serious stories in the works, and we do want to
    reach more emotional range, but the only way we can even try for that is because
    we''re working with established characters in an established universe. What it
    boils down to, I guess, is please have patience and trust us!</p>

    <p>Another thing I''ve heard pretty repetitively has been <strong>Oooh! I know
    where this story is going!</strong> And again I find myself forced to say--Well,
    duh. Predicting where a story is going when it''s told at this pace isn''t truly
    that hard. I hope that what you enjoy is the telling of it, rather than just the
    prediction of where it''s going. As always, serial readers find themselves in
    a very different position than archival readers. </p>

    <p>Two more things to address: One, we''re still getting lots of people writing
    in and asking how they can work with us. <strong>Right now, you can''t. If we''re
    interested in working together, we will come to you.</strong> I know that it''s
    taught, especially in art schools, that there''s no harm in being confident and
    putting yourself out there--but for us, right now, it''s truly more annoying than
    it is helpful. If we''re looking for artists, we''ll let you know, I promise!
    </p>

    <p>Two, dear, sweet, precious, sweet, sweet, readers. If you''re asking <strong>Why
    aren''t we talking about this?!</strong> or <strong>Has anyone else seen this?!</strong>
    I can assure you on both counts that people have seen it and are talking about
    it. In every single instance I have seen of those questions, it is so. Perhaps,
    dear readers, you need to look around a little better. </p>

    <p>If you have any other small questions, in addition to our email, you can shoot
    them to me on <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140428200852/http://rachelpxs.tumblr.com/">my
    tumblr made specifically for that purpose</a> if it delights you to do so. </p>

    <p>Oh--and for goodness'' sake, stop asking about <a href="/pxs/headed-for-stardom/2">that
    rabbit.</a></p>

  body: '<div class="media-body">

    <p>

    </p><p>Well-- I suppose this would be a good time to introduce myself!  My name
    is Matt Hink- as the fourth member of the Paradox Space team, I am the resident
    web developer and in fact, all-round technical guy for the site.  A significant
    portion of my job is taking the (often somewhat unhinged) ideas that the rest
    of the team has and turn them into a functioning website.  As some of you may
    have noticed, this is generally easier said than done. Websites can often be distinctly
    recalcitrant.</p>

    <p>The remainder of my job is attempting not to cry as Tauhid, Kory, and Rachel
    find ways to misuse the site.  I am not particularly good at this.  My beard is
    stained with tears.</p>

    <p>Anyways, circumstances like last night''s outage are likely the only time you''ll
    hear from me, as the rest of the team is much better than I am at saying words
    to people.  But you can rest assured that I am constantly behind the scenes keeping
    a wary and at times paranoid eye over the Paradox Space server(s).</p>

    <p>And now, a few fun facts.</p>

    <p>DID YOU KNOW?  During launch, our rate of requests peaked at around 3500 requests
    per minute, meaning that <strong>every second</strong>, about 58 users were accessing
    the site.  Happily, the wave of the Homestuck fandom didn''t even come close to
    knocking us over.  Since then, we''re down to about 200-300 requests per minute
    over the course of the day.</p>

    <p>DID YOU KNOW?  The 404 (File Not Found) and 500 (Internal Server Error) images
    were drawn by KC Green and Shad Andrews, respectively.</p>

    <p>DID YOU KNOW?  The final pre-launch touches to Paradox Space were made 4 minutes
    and 13 seconds before 4:13 on 04/13?</p>

    <p>Well, now you do.</p>

    <p>Couple notes of recognition: thanks to everyone who''s emailed in bug reports
    to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140430154248/mailto:issues@paradoxspace.com">issues@paradoxspace.com</a>-
    I do read them and generally take them into account.  I''d also like to thank
    everyone who''s sent in encouraging emails to the team- I have this massive amount
    of respect for Rachel, Kory, and Tauhid, who constantly bust their rumps to make
    great stuff for you guys.</p>

    <p>P.S.  To whoever it was on Tumblr that discovered the Swedish translation of
    my last name, thanks a WHOLE lot.  My co-workers found out about it and now they
    won''t stop calling me "bucket".  :(</p>

  title: 'Cat Update: He''s Under the Bikes for Some Reason'
- author: Andrew Hussie
  body: '<div class="media-body">

    <p>

    </p><p>Hello, it''s me again. The fact that it''s me is how you know something
    weird is going on.</p>

    <p>Here''s a cool thing that will happen with this website sometimes. Every now
    and then, we will flip a switch, and that little button that says "2x UPDATE COMBO
    WEEK" will appear up there in the corner. This means for that week, Paradox Space
    will update with two pages per day. </p>

    <p>I know, right? That''s a lot of comics! When the idea for this site was first
    conceived, this is something I pictured as a standard for it. Frequently more
    than one (or even more than two??) pages per day. I would like to work toward
    this being a more common thing for the site. For now though, it will be kind of
    a special thing. It will take some time to make that idea sustainable. Posting
    ten pages in a week burns through a lot of comics! But as this comic-making process
    gets more streamlined, it is my hope that this will occur more often - perhaps
    it will even become normal.</p>

    <p>Part of "making it sustainable" has to do with cost. In case it was not obvious,
    I''m paying all the writers and artists a decent page-rate to make everything
    you see here. In fact, this is probably one of the most expensive webcomics to
    run for that reason. Usually, a webcomic involves one guy like me, who just makes
    a bunch of stuff "for free", puts it up, and whatever the site makes covers server
    costs, and some extra for the webcomic guy to live on. This is a much more distributed
    production though, involving many people. And that''s fine! At one page per day
    we can make that work without a sweat. It''s when you start racking up multiple
    pages per day, the costs start getting kooky. So my intention is to work on figuring
    that out, to make it sustainable. By optimizing ads, printing books, etc. Your
    support, as always, is critical and appreciated.</p>

    <p>What is implied here is that I am thinking in the long term with this site,
    and expecting it to grow and evolve. Part of that is frequency of the content.
    The other part is nature of the content. I spoke of what kind of comics to expect
    here in my initial spiel, but I think I can simplify it further.</p>

    <p>It seems to me there will be two types of content this site runs. The funny
    and gaggy kind, like the one my pal <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140515222130/http://www.gunshowcomic.com/">

    KC Green</a> did a couple weeks ago, and the one running currently by the very
    funny <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140515222130/http://www.gastrophobia.com/">

    David McGuire</a>. These are comics full of laffs, but quite obviously have no
    relation to canon events. Then there is the more "substantive" kind, which conceivably
    could have taken place in canon, and contribute a little more to your understanding
    of the characters and the story overall. The Flarp story last week by Benito and
    Kristin I think fits this description. Sure seems like that arc could have happened
    in canon, doesn''t it? If that is what you would like to believe, you will get
    no argument from me. Eridan getting owned is ALWAYS plausible, the end.</p>

    <p>My sense is that as this comic goes along, the latter type of content will
    be more exciting to the audience. Chuckles are always great, but "substantive"
    elaboration on the characters and universe are understandably seen as more rewarding.
    So I will try to nudge production in that direction. Again, it''ll take some time
    to make that a fully sustainable idea. I can''t just snap my fingers and expect
    other writers to have the comprehensive understanding of all this nonsense that
    I have. It''ll take a while to get there. But I am patient. I am also confident
    that the creative people behind this operation will keep putting out good comics,
    and that this site will continue evolving into something you will find more rewarding
    to visit with each passing month.</p>

    <p>Now let''s all kick back, relax, and google some horse memes.</p>

    <p>Edit: Whoaaa. Those are all HORRIBLE. Let''s forget I suggested that idea!</p>

    <p>

    </p><p>You may have noticed by now that if you squint really hard, there are now
    THINGS at the bottom of each comic page.  These things have colors and words on
    them.  This may confuse and alarm you, but these things have a name.</p>

    <p>They are called TAGS.</p>

    <p>After talking it over in our weekly video calls (during which I usually just
    nod sagely while Kory, Rachel, and Tauhid discuss the finer details of comic scheduling
    and do Actual Work), we decided that what Paradox Space REALLY NEEDS is another
    way for us to insert EVEN MORE hilarious sideline commentary in a website that''s
    already packed to the brim with cool stuff.</p>

    <p>You''ll notice that there are several types of tags which appear at the bottom
    of each page.  The colorful tags describe two things: the creator(s) of the comic,
    and the characters appearing in the comic.  (The Critical Wh8le was granted charactership
    in a landslide victory for curmudgeonly sea mammals worldwide.)</p>

    <p>The not-colorful tags (I''ve heard they''re called ''desaturated'', but I don''t
    approve of that sort of language) are simply other ways for us to make silly and
    pointless remarks about comics.</p>

    <p>Last, but not least, hiding down below the "Recent Stories" panel is a friendly
    button which says TAG CLOUD.  Clicking this will make allllllll of the tags (all
    of them) in the entire comic appear for your perusal.</p>

    <p>Thanks to everyone who''s gotten in touch via issues@paradoxspace.com and questions@paradoxspace.com!</p>

    <p>P.S. Stop hammering the paradoxspace.com/413 url.  There''s nothing there...

    art</a> since forever-ever. In fact, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140521150512/http://www.machall.com/">Mac
    Hall</a> was the first webcomic I''d ever discovered. I''m fan-plotzing right
    now, but as you can see, playing it totally cool. If this was some kind of convention,
    then this post would be the equivalent of my standing by his table all day, ignoring
    subtle hints that it''s way past time I moved on. </p>

    </p><p>Whoa. WHOA. We went a while without speaking there. We''re really sorry.
    We''re not mad at you, we promise. We just get busy sometimes. </p>

    <p>Well! Since we last spoke, you''ve all seen a lot, huh? You saw <a href="/pxs/a-fun-day-for-gcat">A
    Fun Day For GCAT</a> that was written by me and beautifully drawn by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://www.eiffelart.ca/">Matt
    Cummings</a>. Then you saw the exciting, mostly-grey adventure of <a href="/pxs/quality-time">Quality
    Time</a>, which was drawn by the incredible <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://hannibrosh.com/">Hanni
    Brosh</a> and written by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://mspaintadventures.com/">an
    obscure writer you probably haven''t heard of</a>. </p>

    <p>And now here we are, together, with <a href="/pxs/fetch-quest">Fetch
    Quest</a>, written by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://poinko.tumblr.com/">Phil
    Gibson</a> and drawn by <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://www.rice-boy.com/">Evan
    Dahm</a>. Evan''s story <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://www.rice-boy.com/see/">Rice
    Boy</a> was one of the earliest webcomics I got into, and it''s really beautiful,
    as are his other works. I have to admit that I am not current with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://www.rice-boy.com/vattu/">Vattu</a>--ever
    since <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140610063729/http://www.rice-boy.com/order/">Order
    of Tales</a> my preference has been to wait and buy the books when they come out.
    Curling up with a brand new Evan Dahm hardcover knowing it''s all new to you is
    an experience to be cherished. But don''t let that stop you reading those stories!
    I have it on good authority that my waiting around makes me A Weirdo.</p>

    <p>One not-totally-intentional side effect to Paradox Space is that we''re exposing
    a lot of people to artists and writers they might not have known otherwise. We
    really try to work with people whose work we love and admire, which of course
    leads to us approaching artists whose work we''ve followed. We do want to bring
    totally new artists to you, too; but it''s my hope that you''ll follow at least
    one of those author or artist links and find a new love. Homestuck is great, but
    there''s so much more out there too!</p>

    <p>

    </p><p>We have a special meal for you this week! That''s right, it''s a Sweet
    Bro and Hella Jeff Meowrail Sandwich!</p>

    <p>They''re a little more unusual than your garden variety tuna salad so let me
    explain. You take two thin slices of SBAHJ bread--not too much or it will become
    overwhelming--and between them you put a nice sturdy helping of meowrails. Two
    great tastes that taste great together, and need a whole week to be fully enjoyed!</p>

    <p>So what I''m saying is we have one page of SBAHJ to start you off, by the illustrious
    and hilarious <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623113143/http://kcgreendotcom.com/">KC
    Green</a>. KC is a super cool guy and one of the few who really have the chops
    to make something SBAHJ without being over the top. Plus, he just started a cool
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623113143/http://backcomic.com/">comic
    called "Back"</a> that he''s making with <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623113143/http://nedroid.com/">Anthony
    Clark</a>! You should check it out. </p>

    <p>In the middle of the week--right now--we have <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623113143/http://poinko.tumblr.com/">Phil
    Gibson</a>''s second story, "Hunting Lesson," this one illustrated by the extremely
    skilled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623113143/http://paperseverywhere.tumblr.com/">Adrienne
    Garcia</a>, who you may know by the name "paperseverywhere." She came to our attention
    with her gorgeous fan art and we were extremely pleased that she had the time
    and desire to work with us!</p>

    <p>And to round out the week we''ll have one more slice of SBAHJ--but I''ll leave
    that mysterious for now. </p>

    <p>I''m extremely pleased on a personal level that we finally have a story where
    Equius gets to shine. He is my pride and joy, inasmuch as a sweaty, fictional
    alien teen can be such a thing. For a while I was trying to think of something
    special I could do whenever we had an Equius comic, but I ultimately decided that
    I would have to be content with just feeling smug. (Which I do.)</p>

    <p>Finally, a small note. PXS is currently looking for <strong>professional freelance
    inkers</strong>. We have avoided opening submissions in any way because we''re
    more than sure that it would be opening a floodgate we don''t have the time or
    energy to deal with. However, in this case, we are counting on you, our perspicacious
    audience, to self-select wisely. If you are an experienced artist whose inking
    skills are as exemplary as your professionalism, please <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140623113143/mailto:rachel@whatpumpkin.com">shoot
    me an email</a>. In this email, please include a link to your portfolio (not attached
    files), a little about yourself and your level of experience, and any other information
    that might be germane to working with you. If you know someone who fulfills these
    requirements we would vastly prefer that rather than writing in to us with their
    info, you ask them to email us themselves. </p>

    <p>Thanks everyone, hope you enjoy your sandwich! There''s also some potato chips
    to go with it, and a nice apple, because fruits and veggies are important.</p>

    <p>

    </p><p>Hello everyone! I hope you''re enjoying this tea party. Crumpets are over
    there, and cucumber sandwiches are there. Sugar cubes are in this cute little
    pot right here. </p>

    <p>A belated Canada day to all our Canadian readers, and a pre-emptive happy Fourth
    of July to our US-ian readers! I am kind of not so hot on the 4th as a holiday,
    but it''s as good a reason as any to wish people well. </p>

    <p>As many readers have noticed, we''ve been having some troubles with our tags.
    This is due to something Technical that I don''t understand completely enough
    to give you a good explanation for; but rest assured, we''re working on it, and
    will soon have the tags fixed up. We''re also working on some improvements to
    the tag system that we hope to have up in the next week or two. </p>

    <p>I''d also like to ask that if you find any problems while you''re browsing
    the site, you please send an email in to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703024346/mailto:issues@paradoxspace.com">issues@paradoxspace.com</a>,
    as that is the ideal method to let us know there''s something technical going
    on! Sending an email to another address or writing in through Tumblr or Twitter
    is still helpful, but is likely to mean a longer delay in seeing your message
    and addressing the problem.</p>

    <p>I''d also like to thank everyone who wrote in response to my last newspost
    where I asked for inkers to step forward! I received a lot of really nice emails
    with links to some really gorgeous portfolios. We''ve put a whole bunch of new
    names into our useful little artists spreadsheet, and will no doubt be calling
    on many of you in the future! </p>

    <p>Because we had such success asking for inkers, we''re also taking a tentative
    next step: we are looking for writers. However, I want to stress that we are looking
    for <strong>experienced</strong> writers. If this is you, please, as before, <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140703024346/mailto:rachel@whatpumpkin.com">email
    me</a>. Guidelines for these emails: use your <strong>real name</strong>, send
    a <strong>link to your portfolio</strong> (not attached files), be <strong>clear
    about your experience level</strong>, and if you''re feeling especially helpful,
    <strong>give us an idea of your per-page rate</strong>.</p>

    <p>Thanks everyone, hope you''re staying cool! If you''re feeling a bit toasty,
    the iced tea''s right here.</p>

    </p><p>Hello hello!</p>

    <p>Sorry for the radio silence of late; the PXS team is a pretty small one and
    we''ve all been extra busy lately! We appreciate your patience. :)</p>

    <p>Tag system improvements are still in the works, currently taking a back seat
    to longer-term and larger-scale technical stuff that should improve both the performance
    of both PXS and MSPA itself. Sorry about that; I know the tags are often a bit
    off! </p>

    <p>We''ve had reports of a malicious, hijacking ad. <strong>THIS IS NOT OKAY BY
    US.</strong> Sometimes bad ads can get through the ad service we use, much to
    our chagrin. If this happens to you, please email issues@paradoxspace.com with
    as much information as you can get! This includes the ad itself, where the ad
    sent you, what browser you''re using, anything. Thank you! We want this to happen
    as little as possible, and that means getting info to the ad service as fast as
    we can to get the offending ad axed.</p>

    <p>We''ve had some stories from new contributors lately! Big PXS welcomes to <a
    href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140802131502/http://www.maryborsellino.com/mary/">Mary

    <p>We are still going through some of the portfolios that we''ve been linked,
    both for writers and inkers. We may soon be looking for colorists; keep an eye
    on this space, and get your portfolios ready! </p>

    </p><p>Okay, so the holiday wishes are a bit early, but DAMARA is an extra-spooky
    comic especially produced for Halloween, so! Here we are.</p>

    <p>You may have noticed that this comic is in black and white! That''s because
    DAMARA is an homage to the work of Junji Ito, particularly "TOMIE". If you like
    spooky manga, check it out! (You can read DAMARA without reading TOMIE first,
    but it may make more sense if you do.) (A note: TOMIE has some mature content,
    particularly gore.)</p>

    <p>In less-specific news: new contributors!! It''s been a while since our last
    news post (not a lot to report, sorry!) but you should be sure to check out the
    contributor panel for info and links on our new artists!! DAMARA is inked by the
    fantastic Tom Siddell (go read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141024091325/http://www.gunnerkrigg.com/">Gunnerkrigg
    Court</a> right now. It''s okay, I''ll wait here until you finish) and I also
    want to give shout-outs to Incineraptor and Mary Cagle!!

    Oh, and there''s me I guess. Hi! My name is Blueberry and I''m an Assistant Editor

    <p>Starting today and continuing for the next five weeks, we''ll be exploring

    sketched by the incredibly skilled <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141211214647/http://deadwinter.cc/">Allison

    Wiedle</a>, whose lettering has been invaluable on past comics, and whose comic

    </p><p>Blueberry already mentioned that the wonderful <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226071941/http://gastrophobia.com/">David
    McGuire</a> did our surprise holiday Activity Pages, but I just uploaded some
    nice <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226071941/http://pxscomics.tumblr.com/post/105841176530/here-are-proper-print-sized-activity-sheets-for">print-sized
    versions of them over at the Paradox Space Tumblr</a> so y''all can have some
    nice print outs!</p>

    <p>I''d also like to mention that Secret Sufferer is at 25 page long comic, but
    it''s broken up into a couple smaller stories, so don''t be alarmed that Friday''s
    page and today''s page seem to take a jump! It will all come around in the end,
    I promise! Also take note! This week is a special 2X UPDATE COMBO week! Just for
    you! Happy Holidays! Big thanks to <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226071941/http://poinko.tumblr.com/">Phil
    Gibson</a> and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20141226071941/http://www.eiffelart.ca/">Matt

    </p><p>Hey all! </p>

    <p>As you might have heard from <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417023211/http://www.mspaintadventures.com/">the
    latest newspost</a>, PXS will be taking a hiatus starting today! Keep an eye out
    here and on MSPA for news as it occurs. (Speaking of which, if you haven''t seen
    <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150417023211/https://twitter.com/pxscomics/status/585199014221651970">this
    teaser</a> yet, now''s the time to see it and get excited!) In the meantime, we''d
    like to thank each and every one of you who''ve supported us during this past
    year. It''s been a new experience for all of us, and we''re so grateful you came
    along with us on this weird little journey!</p>

    <p>From myself personally, I''d like to extend an extra thanks to everyone we''ve
    worked with--especially my coworkers, the other editors of PXS, who are hardworking,
    tireless, and lovely. I''d also like to thank all the visual artists, writers,
    designers, and other freelancers we''ve worked with, who have sweat blood for
    what are objectively very silly stories, and to whom I could not be more grateful
    or appreciative. Working with, as they say, "creatives" is my favorite part of
    the job and I feel very humbled and lucky to have worked with you all!</p>

    <p>Happy 413, everyone. :)</p>
