    that delight and titillate audiences by the dozens and is also an experienced graphic 
    designer. If you are admiring some aspect of design on this site, then you have him to 
    thank for it. If you are, however, critical of said design elements, chances are Tauhid 
    already doesn't like you and would recommend keeping your dumb opinions to yourself.
